               <p>This website is dedicated to provide you with information from the 3 main generations of the Game Boy line from Nintendo. Not only does this website discuss all of the models of the Game Boy, but it will also discuss popular games along with mods to make your playing experience even better.</p>
               <p>The Game Boy is a handheld line up from Nintendo which was released in 1989. This was a successor to the Game & Watch, and added some new features. For example, the Game Boy loaded games from a cartridge. This made swapping games much easier. The first model of the Game Boy, also known as the DMG, used real AA batteries, instead of the watch batteries that the Game & Watch used.</p>
               <p>To keep the Game Boy alive, Nintendo released many revisions of the handheld. I will discuss this more in the above articles, but some of the revisions included better portability, color, 32-bit processing, and rechargable batteries.</p>
               <p>The last model of the Game Boy, the Game Boy Micro, was released in 2005. At this point, Nintendo had decided to move foward with there DS line of devices and leave the Game Boy behind. Although it was sad to see the Game Boy line end, it had a pretty good life span. Nintendo had made a lot of history in those 16 years.</p>
               <p><em>Note: The models listed in the guide are only official North American models. This excludes models such as the Game Boy Light, Super Game Boy 2, Wide Boy 64, etc.</em></p>
