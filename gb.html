               <hr />
               <p>Game Boys use a custom 8 bit CPU made by Sharp. It is similar to the architecture of a Z80 processor, and is clocked at 4.19 MHz. It featured 8kB of RAM, and 8kB of Video RAM. The sound in the Game Boy supported 2 pulse wave generators, 1 noise generator, and audio input from cartridges. Game Boy handhelds produced mono sound, but could do stereo through a headphone jack. The screen resolution is 160 by 144 pixels. The color palette was 2-bit, meaning that each pixel had 4 color options. Those were dark, light, and 2 stages between. The Game Boy supported everything from 256kb cartridges to 8 Mb cartridges. The controls on Game Boy models featured A & B buttons, a D-pad, and Start & Select.</p>

               <h3>Game Boy (DMG)</h3>
               <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Game-Boy-FL.png/1200px-Game-Boy-FL.png" width="15%" class="image-right" />
               <p>The original handheld that started it all! This handheld was released in 1989. It was a farely simple handheld, but because of Nintendo's dominance in the console market, it crushed the competition. This model sold over 100 million units, compared to the Sega Game Gear's 10 million.</p>
               <p>Some people may refer to this one as the "big brick." It was fairly big for a portable. The device was 5.8 inches tall, 3.5 inches wide, and 1.3 inches thick. Although it may have been smaller than the competition, it is nowhere near as small ad the devices we have today. The device had decent battery life, but it required 4 AA batteries! None of the other Game Boys on this list required so many batteries. Most of the DMG's were an off white color, but other colors were released late in its life span. These models were known as the "Play It Loud!" series, and the colors offered were red, green, black, yellow, white, blue, and clear.</p>
               <p>The biggest downside of an original Game Boy is its screen. It was small, only coming in at 2.6 inches diagonal. There was no builtin lighting, so the screen relied on reflected light, similar to a calculator. The screen had a green hue that most people disliked, and it was prone to ghosting.</p>
               <h3>Game Boy Pocket (GBP)</h3>
               <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Game-Boy-Pocket-FL.jpg/168px-Game-Boy-Pocket-FL.jpg" width="13%" class="image-right" />
               <p>This was the first major revision to the Game Boy. This unit was much smaller and thinner, hence the name "Pocket." This device was released in 1996, 7 years after the DMG. To elimate space, the Game Boy Pocket used 2 AAA batteries instead of the DMG's 4 AA batteries. This is fine for the most part, but can make modding difficult because of how little power the AAA batteries provide. It is also not suggested to use flash carts (cartriges with custom/multiple ROMs) with the Pocket, as they usually need more power than the Pocket can provide.</p>
               <p>Another major issue fixed with the Pocket was the screen. Although the screen had a similar size to the DMG and still relied on reflected light, contrast was much better on this unit. It's colors were shades of gray instead of green. Although ghosting can still be visible, the unit handled it much better.</p>
               <h3>Super Game Boy (SGB)</h3>

               <p>At the time, releasing a Game Boy with builtin lighting would have been expensive. In order to address the complaints of the Game Boy screen without releasing a new handheld, Nintendo made the Super Game Boy in 1994. This was an adapter cartridge for the Super Nintendo. Because the Super Nintendo lacked the power to do Game Boy emulation, there was Game Boy hardware builtin to the cartridge itself. Without the screen and buttons, of course. You inserted your cartridges at the top of the Super Game Boy, and the Super Game Boy would steal power, video output, and controller input from your Super Nintendo.</p>
               <p>Playing Game Boy games on your TV was pretty cool, but the Super Game Boy had even better features. The Super Game Boy had special color palettes so you could view your games in color. Some games could even go beyond the 2-bit palette.</p>
               <p>The only downside of the Super Game Boy was that it lacked a link port, so you couldn't hook up your real Game Boy to the Super Game Boy. The hardware in the Super Game Boy was also slightly faster than an actual Game Boy, so your games would run slightly faster as well. The speed difference is not noticable to most people. If it is a big deal to you, there are mods to fix the speed problem, and both problems were fixed in the Super Game Boy 2.</p>
